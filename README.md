Impact of previous campaign outcomes on conversion probability • Structured the dashboard layout for clear business storytelling and performance interpretation

Key Insights

• Overall conversion rate stands at 11.27%, indicating significant funnel drop-off (88.73%) • Cellular outreach achieves higher conversion efficiency compared to telephone campaigns • Increasing contact attempts does not proportionally increase conversions, indicating diminishing returns • Campaigns with previously successful outcomes show higher future conversion probability • Conversion performance fluctuates across months, highlighting potential campaign timing impact

Business Recommendations
